# A Postcard from Esri

This is our entry for the [Thursday, March 7th Demo Theater session](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit/agenda/agenda) at [Esri Developer Summit 2019](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit/overview) in Palm Springs, CA.

It is a basemap visually enhanced with a custom layer that uses WebGL to display scenic elements such as trees swaying in the wind and a realistic water effect.
There are also some fire pits with flames and smoke.

All these visual elements are influenced by simulated wind speed and direction.

The app implements a lighting model that enables the user to visualize the scene at different times of the day, like noon, evening and night.

This is still a map, where you can pan, zoom, rotate and use all of the features of the API, including geolocation, popups, widgets and screenshot.

Using the screenshots feature, we implemented a photo mode where users can take a picture of what's on screen, to maybe share it or set it as desktop background.
